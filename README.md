## Acknowledgments

- FastAPI for providing a high-performance, easy-to-use framework for building APIs.
- jsonpickle for making it easy to serialize and deserialize complex Python objects to and from JSON.
- SQLite for providing a lightweight disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process.
- numpy for providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
